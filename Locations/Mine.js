/*
    (TODO): Make global variables containing information about the mountain.

    (TODO): Make a "MountainSection" class that contains a random amount of rocks within a range and places them on a two-dimensional
    grid(array), and keep track of all the miners that are in that specific "MountainSection" class instance.

    (TODO): Assign all the rocks in the mountain section to a single miner each.

    (TODO): Make a hard-coded two-dimensional array where each element contains an instance of the "MountainSection" class if there
    is a mountain section at that coordinate.

    (TODO): Draw the background, rocks, and miners in the mountain section currently selected onto the canvas.

    (TODO): Make the "mountainMap" be dynamically generated.
